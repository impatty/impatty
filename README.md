- 👋 Hi, I’m Armaan Pathan working as a SDE trainee at TATA CONSULTANCY SERVICES (TCS ). 
- 👀 It was my college time when I found programming to be interesting and chose this stream for the career. More specifically web development is my core competency but I'm now trying to move to hybrid mobile development as well. I like to experiment new things that interest me and call myself a LEARNER.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all sorts of project where I can enhance my learning and deliver value to the project. I always try to learn something new each day that drives me to keep going.
